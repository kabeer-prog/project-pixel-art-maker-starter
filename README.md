The App takes input from the user and makes Pixel Images from the input

SKills
Defining variables with const and let
Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
Writing nested loops and using loop variables


// To do this project we need to pick them one by one using JavaScript codes like ;

// //'pick' the elements like so;
// document.getElementById('inputHeight')
// which you "pick" the element with your code and do some "programming" on it.



// document.getElementById('sizePicker').addEventListener(....)
// Above code "picks" the element 'sizePicker' from the DOM and adds an event listener to it so we can interact with it.,


// You will need to access the inputs and form elements. These may help: document.getElementById or document.querySelector. Don't forget to assign them to variables.
// Then, you need to listen when a user submits the form with addEventListener.
// Inside the submit listener, you'll need a function which builds the grid. Get the inputs value and loop through them, adding rows to the table (you will need to get the table element) and cells to each row. insertRow and insertCell are your friends here.
// You will need to add click listeners to paint cells as well.
// One of the behaviors you want is: when a user clicks on a cell, paint it. If you have the cell in a variable, what about adding a click event right after creating it? And you want to change its background (remember: CSS "color" property is to change the font color) by the colorPicker value.
